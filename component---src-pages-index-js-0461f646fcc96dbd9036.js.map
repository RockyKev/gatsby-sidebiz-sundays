From building apps, do client work, selling products... I've also used this time to learn to code, complete certifications and work on my portfolio. There's also little things: did my taxes, fixed my motorcycle, and wrote Christmas cards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Start your week with a <strong>burst of productivity</strong> and use your Sundays to eat that frog, whatever it may be!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Where</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Sidebiz Sundays is held on Sundays at 10am ET, 7am PT. \r\nIt worked when I lived in the East coast. But I'm commited to sticking with those hours, even now that I live in the West Coast.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cost</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Only 2 hours of your Sunday.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Origins</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Sidebiz Sundays was created in early 2014 when I, Rocky, realized I would waste my Sundays. I felt miserable and uninspired, and would bring that energy to work on Monday. I finally made a commitment to turn my sunday mornings into an engine of productivity. The first iteration was a group of friends who met at a cofee shop. It then moved online, and has been consistently online for the past few years, and will continue in the near future.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"thesidebizsundaysstructure\">The Sidebiz Sundays Structure</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The structure has been changed a few times since it's initial iteration.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cDansAZ.png\" alt=\"schedule\"></img>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>10 minutes</strong> - Fill out your Project Task</li>\r\n<li><strong>40 minutes</strong> - WORK SPRINT #1 - Stay in the zoom room and work<br /></li>\r\n<li><strong>10 minutes</strong> - Short break - refocus on your Project task</li>\r\n<li><strong>40 minutes</strong> - WORK SPRINT #2 - stay in the zoom room and work<br /></li>\r\n<li><strong>10 minutes</strong> - Fill out your Results</li>\r\n<li><strong>10 minutes</strong> - Final Q&amp;A and Wrap-up conversations</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n  </div>\r\n)\r\n\r\n/* \r\nPowershell -> gatsby develop\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/#create-a-gatsby-site\r\n\r\nYou’ll be able to visit the site locally at http://localhost:8000 for as long as your development server is running.
