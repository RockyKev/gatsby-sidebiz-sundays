<h2 id="whatissidebizsundays">What is Sidebiz Sundays</h2>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>The goal of Sidebiz Sundays is to supercharge your Sunday morning in a concentrated form. </p>

<p>Since the inception, I have used Sidebiz Sundays to work on my Sidebiz. From building apps, do client work, selling products... I've also used this time to learn to code, complete certifications and work on my portfolio. There's also little things: did my taxes, fixed my motorcycle, and wrote Christmas cards.</p>

<p>Start your week with a <strong>burst of productivity</strong> and use your Sundays to eat that frog, whatever it may be!</p>

<h3>Where</h3>

<p>Sidebiz Sundays is held on Sundays at 10am ET, 7am PT. 
It worked when I lived in the East coast. But I'm commited to sticking with those hours, even now that I live in the West Coast.</p>

<h3>Cost</h3>

<p>Only 2 hours of your Sunday.</p>

<h2>Origins</h2>

<p>Sidebiz Sundays was created in early 2014 when I, Rocky, realized I would waste my Sundays. I felt miserable and uninspired, and would bring that energy to work on Monday. I finally made a commitment to turn my sunday mornings into an engine of productivity. The first iteration was a group of friends who met at a cofee shop. It then moved online, and has been consistently online for the past few years, and will continue in the near future.</p>

<h2 id="thesidebizsundaysstructure">The Sidebiz Sundays Structure</h2>

<p>The structure has been changed a few times since it's initial iteration.</p>

You’ll be able to visit the site locally at http://localhost:8000 for as long as your development server is running. That’s the process you started by running the gatsby develop command. To stop running that process (or to “stop running the development server”), go back to your terminal window, hold down the “control” key, and then hit “c” (ctrl-c). To start it again, run gatsby develop again!
